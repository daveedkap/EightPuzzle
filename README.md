# EightPuzzle
My take on the classic eight-puzzle presents a way to represent the state of a puzzle using both uninformed (random, BFS, DFS) and informed (Greedy, A* Search) search strategies. Additionally, heuristic functions allow the program to make informed decisions about which states are more promising than others based on calculated estimates.
